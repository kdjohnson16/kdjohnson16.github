        <h1>Professional Summary</h1>
        <p>I am a graduate student in the Religion in Culture Masters program at The University of Alabama, as well as a student in the Museum Studies Certificate program. 
            I received a Bachelor's in Anthropology from The University of Alabama, summa cum laude, in 2021. I also studied Classical language and history, earning a minor in both Ancient Greek and Latin. 
            My interests lie in educational and cultural outreach. As part of my graduate studies, I currently serve as the graduate research assistant for Global Café, a global outreach program within the Division of Community Affairs that helps transition international students and community members who have relocated to Tuscaloosa to American society and culture.
