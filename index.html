        <h2>A Brief Biogrpahy</h2>
        <p>Born on the mean streets of Moundville, Alabama, Oatmeal's lived his first 8 weeks at an old country gas station. Skittish at first, Oatmeal was eventually rescued and now lives in his forever home.</p>

        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>Oatmeal is a Blue Point Siamese cat with a white boy, a dark gray tails, and blue eyes. He also has patches of dark gray that frame the left side of his face.</p>

        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>The words that best describe Oatmeal include playful, friendly, and sneaky. Like a typical cat, Oatmeal is always up to trouble. He loves nothing more than to get into things he shouldn't. Nevertheless, he is an incredidly loving boy who loves nothing more than to snuggle with you. When he's not snuggling, Oatmeals loves to play with his favorite toys. Like all Siamese cats, Oatmeal is also a bit of a chatty cathy and will speak with you all day long if you let him.</p>
