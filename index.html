        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>The words that best describe Oatmeal include playful, friendly, and sneaky. Like a typical cat, Oatmeal is always up to trouble. He loves nothing more than to get into things he shouldn't. Nevertheless, he is an incredidly loving boy who loves nothing more than to snuggle with you. When he's not snuggling, Oatmeals loves to play with his favorite toys. Like all Siamese cats, Oatmeal is also a bit of a chatty cathy and will speak with you all day long if you let him.</p>
